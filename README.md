# dotfiles - Mac OSX, Ubuntu or Fedora
A dotfiles repo, or more accurately a collection of 
install scripts pulling in everything one might need to 
get a server or local development machine running.

Being that I use docker, I do not install any webserver (Apache/Nginx) locally
But rather pull in [a dockerfile](https://github.com/MarnuLombard/ubuntu-php7) 
that contains a LAMP stack.

## Please note
I seriously don't recommend that you run this on your own server or local
machine. But clone it, fork it - and have a look inside.  
This is built on the shoulders of giants. None of these Ideas are my own
I've only grabbed the best scripts that are out there.

## What's inside?
__These scripts set up the following__

* Exports
* Copy over .files
* Vim
* Fish Shell
* Git
* Docker
* PHP
* Node.js
* Fonts
* _OSX config_ (Mac only)
* _Homebrew_ (Mac only)

## How it works
